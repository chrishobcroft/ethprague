I will give my suggestions for requirements but others might have other ideas. Let's resolve any conflict together?

# Overview

There will be 4 stages across 4 days of Prague DeFi and ethprague. From outside, they are two separate events. On the inside, they have strong common thread (same venues, same organising team, same pretalx, same video production team).

# Talks/Speakers

## Main Stage (La Fabrika)

### Video

Propose similar setup to last year: one staticam for full stage, one camera with operator for closeups.

Closeup camera should be located to not block people's paths.

Should be able to put these to the bjg screen: slides, staticam, closeup cam and master broadcast-signal.

Also should have low-down monitors with time and slides, for speaker cue.

### Audio

2 handsfree mic(s) for speakers, stage manager to manage mic swapping with volunteer.

1 clicker for slides.



Main stage MC should have earpiece and handsfree mic.

# Side Stage(s)

For smaller stage(s) with talks, should have 1 staticam capturing full stage, speaker, and projector. Try to get the lighting balance right, to get slides very visible (as this is the priority), while also showing the human, and then it really can be this simple.

2 mics each stage: 1 for speaker, 1 with a volunteer to give voice to IRL audience.



Alternative video setup would be to livestream audio from mics and *only* slides from screencap, which removes the need for a camera and optimises for the content: slides and audio.

2. Questions from the Remote Audience: needs a way to introduce the questions being output by the synchronous AMA tool. Propose a set of rolling volunteer/interns to be ready with microphone to introduce the question(s). Target is to have at least 1 question from remote audience.

3. Workshop cameras: priority is to share audio (2 workshop coordinators mic'd up, plua a room mic for questions) volunteer to
