I will give my suggestions for requirements but others might have other ideas. Let's resolve any conflict together?

# Overview

There will be 4 stages across 4 days of Prague DeFi and ethprague. From outside, they are two separate events. On the inside, they have strong common thread (same venues, same organising team, same pretalx, same video production team).

Each of the 4 stages to have its own livestream, and we don't press "Stop Streaming" until Sunday night. Use content from venue (see below) to fill any "dead" time.

# Talks/Speakers

## Main Stage (La Fabrika)

### Video

Propose similar setup to last year: one staticam for full stage, one camera with operator for closeups.

Closeup camera should be located to not block people's paths.

Should be able to put these to the bjg screen: slides, staticam, closeup cam and master broadcast-signal.

Also should have low-down monitors with time and slides, for speaker cue.

### Audio

2 handsfree mic(s) for speakers, stage manager to manage mic swapping with volunteer.

2 handheld mic(s) held by volunteers in audience to a) read questions from AMA from remote participants (see below), b) connect IRL audience to the AV (e.g. questions). Objective: to have at least 1 question from remote audience.


Main stage MC should have earpiece and handsfree mic.

### Other

1 clicker for slides.




# Side Stage(s)

## Video

1 staticam capturing full stage, speaker, and projector.

Set the lighting so that slides are very visible (as this is the visual priority), while also showing the human, and then it really can be this simple.

### Alternative

Livestream *only* the slides from screencap. This removes the need for a camera and optimises for the valuable content: slides and audio. Maybe can put a well-placed staticam as a picture-in-picture but this might not be mecessary.

## Audio

2 handheld mics for each stage: 1 for speaker, 1 with a volunteer to give voice to IRL audience and to relay questions from AMA tool (see below).


# Workshops

## Video

HDMI cable for workshop facilitator to plug into (requires coordination via Camilla for comm's for speakers), and monitor showing that the connection has worked. Livestream what gets published to this HDMI cable. No need for camera.

## Audio

2 handsfree mic(s) for workshop facilitators, volunteers to manage mic swapping between workshops.

1 room mic for capturing general ambience and any questions.

# Venue (note on Privacy)

Objective: to capture and share a sense of the mass of human energy from across the entire event. Must be careful to preserve privacy.

Can be used to "fill" time as required,
e.g. between talks, or after talks have finished for the day.

Try to include energy from all venues including Vnitroblock.



## Video

2 (or more) staticams, positioned carefully around the venue(s), with narrow depth of field to focus on an objet d'art, non-human mascot or similar in the foregroumd (ideally something dynamic to give a sense of movement), but showing (heavily-blurred / anonymised) human energy in the background.


Bonus points if we can mount one outside and show trees and humans and sunlight and nature.

## Audio

Room-mic (maybe auto-levelling) with each camera, to capture general ambience.

# Culture

## The Band (Justin, Jakub and friends)

A band has been forming in recent years in the Ethereum community. Led by Justin (big brained cryptography guy) supported by Jakub (ethprague 2022/23 organising team helper), with other local musicians combining vocals, guitar, mandolin, accordion, violin etc.

Rehearsals will recommence 2 weeks before the event.

Their tech rider is [here](https://github.com/chrishobcroft/ethprague/blob/09639fc5cd576fa55cd7f39eb73793de3bd30ec1/Justin-Holmes-technical-rider-3.0.0.pdf).

There will also be Yoga, Sound Healing



# Media Platform

Content will be shared via a web3-native livestream publishing platform. 



## Platform

Live content (4K 30Mbps Video with synchronised 320kbps Stereo Audio)

will be published in `16x9` aspect ratio, as `rtmp` or `SRT`, to [livepeer.studio](https://livepeer.studio)'s hosted API.

Published content will be recorded at source, as no guarantees can be made that content will be stored remotely.

## User Experience

The platform will be composed of a set of web3 primitives to provide an interactive user-centric experience combining media, communication and governance.

### Live Video Stream

There will be 1 live video stream for each stage (see above), consisting of synchronised video and audio.

This stream can be play/paused, mute/unmute, and a rewound as far as the content is cached in the browser session. It can also be made full screen, and available as pop-out player on mobile (@vablov please confirm).
