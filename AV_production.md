I will give my suggestions for requirements but others might have other ideas. Let's resolve any conflict together?

# Overview

There will be 4 stages across 4 days of Prague DeFi and ethprague. From outside, they are two separate events. On the inside, they have strong common thread (same venues, same organising team, same pretalx, same video production team).

# Talks/Speakers

## Main Stage (La Fabrika)

### Video

Propose similar setup to last year: one staticam for full stage, one camera with operator for closeups.

Closeup camera should be located to not block people's paths.

Should be able to put these to the bjg screen: slides, staticam, closeup cam and master broadcast-signal.

Also should have low-down monitors with time and slides, for speaker cue.

### Audio

2 handsfree mic(s) for speakers, stage manager to manage mic swapping with volunteer.

2 handheld mic(s) held by volunteers in audience to a) read questions from AMA from remote participants (see below), b) connect IRL audience to the AV (e.g. questions). Objective: to have at least 1 question from remote audience.


Main stage MC should have earpiece and handsfree mic.

### Other

1 clicker for slides.




# Side Stage(s)

## Video

1 staticam capturing full stage, speaker, and projector.

Set the lighting so that slides are very visible (as this is the visual priority), while also showing the human, and then it really can be this simple.

### Alternative

Livestream *only* the slides from screencap. This removes the need for a camera and optimises for the valuable content: slides and audio. Maybe can put a well-placed staticam as a picture-in-picture but this might not be mecessary.

## Audio

2 handheld mics for each stage: 1 for speaker, 1 with a volunteer to give voice to IRL audience and to relay questions from AMA tool (see below).


# Workshops

## Video

HDMI cable for workshop facilitator to plug into (requires coordination via Camilla for comm's for speakers), and monitor showing that the connection has worked. Livestream what gets published to this HDMI cable. No need for camera.

## Audio

2 handsfree mic(s) for workshop facilitators, volunteers to manage mic swapping between workshops.

1 room mic for capturing general ambience and any questions.
